I'm Eetu, a Game Designer and Developer with a strong foundation in UI/UX and Service Design, developed over 7 years in highly complex, agile environments. 

As a skilled generalist, I bring a unique ability to gain insights and facilitate understanding between disciplines of game design, development, narrative and art. My approach blends these varied domains to create novel and holistic gameplay experiences.
