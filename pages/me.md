I'm Eetu, a game designer based in Helsinki. Here you can find some of my work as well as occasional notes on play, game design and other topics.

I have previously worked as an in-house designer and design consultant with companies such as VR, Elisa, Nitor and Nightingale Health and I have over 7 years of experience from UI/UX and service design as well as other areas surrounding business development and mobile product development in agile, multi-disciplinary teams.
