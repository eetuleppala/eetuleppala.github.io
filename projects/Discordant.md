## Contributions
During the fall of 2022 I was a part of a 6-member team creating Discordant, a rythm-based bullet hell game. The game was developed over the course of three months as a part of a game project course in Aalto University. My responsibilities included among other things:

- Story conceptualization around a set of established core mechanics
- Enemy type design
- Level layout design from tutorialization to more challenging levels
- Playtesting and task design
- Art direction to ensure cohesiveness (other team members actually produced the assets)
- Game production

## Design Highlights

[Img of health and difficulty mechanic]
<div class="small"> ↑ Health = progress = difficulty. Early on we had problems with how to control difficulty in situations where the player is still learning or they just lose their grip on the controller etc. which was pretty common since the game was so fast-paced. I came up with a system of tying player health and progression to the difficulty of each battle. This meant that each player would have to surmount the hardest part of the level in order to progress, acting as a skill-lock, but also acted as a buffer for all the edge-cases mentioned above, because every time you would get hit and lose health, the game would become a bit easier, allowing for regaining control. This feature got a lot of positive feedback in the playtesting sessions both from experienced players as well as novices. </div>

[Img of enemy types and related challenges]
<div class="small"> ↑ Different enemy types. Early on we noticed the need for different kinds of challenges when it came to combining agile movement and managing enemy attacks to the beat.</div>

[Img of level design]
<div class="small"> ↑ Various levels from the end of the game. In order to ramp up difficulty we wanted the levels themselves also provide a maneovering challenge. This combined with various trap elements meant we had quite a bit of possibilities for scaling the difficulty. A lot of the level layouts were changed in accordance with playtesting data. For example obstacles and chasms were thought of as similar types of challenges, but it turned out a lot of the players got stuck in the obstacle geometry and thus wasn't difficult in a fun sense, so we eliminated a lot of them.</div>
