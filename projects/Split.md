With powers that can twist the reality itself, two creatures trapped in a research facility are trying to escape.

Split is a puzzle-platformer for two players. (Or one player with especially good coordination skills). It consists of 5 brain twisting levels and has about 30 minutes of playing time.

## Contributions
The game was created during a week-long game jam. The theme of the jam was "The Twist". Our interpretation of the topic was to twist the genre of split screen games in a way that you could travel through the split, to each others’ screens.

<!-- ## Design Highlights

<div class="small"> ↑ Even for us as designer wrapping our brain around the core mechanic was difficult. A moment of clarity came when we formulated the concept as "playing the screen" as in the key to solving the puzzles was positioning the screen edges advantageously and not necessarily the characters.</div> -->
