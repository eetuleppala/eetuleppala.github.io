title: 'Wasteland'
---

Waste Land is a trading and area-control board game. Players aim to grow their energy empire every turn by trading properties, facilities and money with other players to reach their goals. Every action also manipulates global pool of waste that everyone needs to manage collectively to avoid global ecological collapse, bringing into the game an aspect of shifting loyalties and shift between competition and collaboration. Player with most money at the end of 6 rounds wins.

## Contributions
The game was part of my graduate thesis and while playable, lacks polish and extended features and can be considered more of a proof of concept. For the game I:

- Formulated a high-level design vision based on the aims and hypotheses of my thesis
- Researched and narrowed down on a real-world system that would suit for the purposes of my thesis
- Designed and balanced cards that would convey the real-world system dynamics while also staying fun and challenging as a game
- Defined and iterated on the ruleset informed by the playtesting data
- And everything else
