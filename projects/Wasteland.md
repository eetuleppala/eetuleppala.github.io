Waste Land is a trading and area-control board game. Players aim to grow their energy empire every turn by trading properties, facilities and money with other players to reach their goals. Every action also manipulates a global pool of waste that everyone needs to manage collectively to avoid an all-encompassing ecological collapse, bringing into the game an aspect of shifting loyalties. Player with most money at the end of 6 rounds wins.

## Contributions
For this proof of concept game I:

- Formulated a high-level design vision based on the aims and hypotheses of my thesis, which this game was a part of
- Researched energy and geopolitics and extracted interesting aspects to formulate into game prototypes
- Prototypes various resolutions of real-world energy systems to find a compromise between an engaging game and an accurate-enough representation of the system
- Balanced gameplay mechanics in spreadsheets
- Utilised Tabletop Simulator for remote testing

## Design Highlights

<div class="small"> ↑ The infrastructure cards. These cards made the decision on where to build extremely important, as you as a player wanted to build an effective energy empire while simultaneously thwarting others. Cascading effects might surprise unprepared players quickly. </div>

<div class="small"> ↑ I wanted the game board to represent the real world, as I noticed that eariler, abstracted versions of the board made players more ruthless, than in this version where the actual planet was represented. </div>
