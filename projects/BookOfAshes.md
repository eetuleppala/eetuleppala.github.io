## Contributions
This is an ongoing solo project, 

- Formulating and maintaining design vision to steer design and development decisions
- Balancing in accordance with the wanted experience
- Playtesting sessions throughout development
- Developing a modular system and tooling for producing agents, abilities and conditions fast and reliably
- Developing a level editor and modular tiletypes to product emergent behaviour
- Designed systems to present relevant information only when needed
- And everything else.

## Design Highlights

[Img of heroes and their description and abilities]
<div class="small"> ↑ Some of the heroes in the game. I wanted the heroes and their abilities to produce a feeling of surviving against overwhelming odds by using unorthodox methods. </div>

[Imgs of levels in level editor, with tags, overlay with room sketch as well as indicate formations and booster/room flow]
<div class="small"> ↑ Levels and spawnpoints. I wanted the levels to encourage the players to move around the space with their small unit of guerilla fighters, while the enemies were positioned in more traditional military formations (vanguard etc.). The levels are generally divided into rooms, at least conceptually. Each room has boosters to encourage moving into them and executing awesome turns.</div>

[Img of tiletypes and effects]
<div class="small"> ↑ Different tiletypes. Manouvering and altering the battlefield is a crucial aspect in the game. These also effect pathfinding for all agents to for example avoid hazards and difficult terrain unless absolutely necessary. I also added rules for enemies to not stand next to walls or on the edge of the map in order to give the player more opportunities to strike. </div>

[Img of enemies. Tiers of enemies and their abilities and how they are more severe than the previous.]
<div class="small"> ↑ Some of the enemies in the game. I wanted each enemy to provide a specific type of challenge. For this battle demo I wanted to highlight the theme of fire in the story and mirror it in the game mechanics. Each enemy group has a progression of difficulties in the enemy units. </div>
